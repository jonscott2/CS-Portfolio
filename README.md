#Software Design Document
  In CS-230, we were tasked with drafting a design plan to expand our client The Gaming Room's game "Draw It or Lose It" to other gaming platforms.
  The Gaming Room wanted Draw It or Lose It to reach as many consumers as possible while limiting costs and maintaining efficiency. I drafted a chart 
  comparing a Linux, Windows, Mac, or mobile platform implementation to visualize why a linux-based approach would best suit the needs of the client.
  Linux offers a free and open-source hosting platform that fulfills all of The Gaming Room's requirements. Having a completed Software Design Document 
  removed many questions developers often face, such as "How will I make this work?" or "How should this class relate?" from the development process. 
  The Majority of questions were addressed prior to the first line of code being written, making the implementation simple and effecient. If I were to 
  revise the Software Design Document, I would expand the Evaluation chart to include greater detail. I summarized the features of each Operating
  System succinctly, but more detail would benefit The Gaming Room when making their final decision. To complete the Design Document, I had to understand 
  what The Gaming Room's requirements were. By reading their project submission, I could identify they needed a design that could have multiple instances 
  running at a time, each player needed a team, and it needed to save game information. Understanding your client's requirements is half of your job as 
  a software design consultant, making it essential. I approached software design methodically by breaking it into pieces. Completing the design in 
  sections allowed me time to reflect on previous entries. If there was a section I was unhappy with, I could revise it before it caused an issue. In 
  the future, I will develope code slowly and methodically to ensure I can deliver a functional product I can be proud of.
